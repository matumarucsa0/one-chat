# Discord Clone

This is a Discord clone application that allows users to engage in real-time messaging through direct messages and group messages. Unlike the original Discord platform, this clone does not include servers and call rooms. It is built using several technologies, including Flask, Socket.IO, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

-   **Direct Messaging:** Users can send direct messages to each other privately, creating one-on-one conversations. This feature enables seamless communication between individuals within the application.
-   **Group Messaging:** Users can create or join group messages with multiple participants. Group messages facilitate collaboration and enable users to communicate with multiple people simultaneously.
-   **Real-time Messaging:** The application utilizes Socket.IO to provide real-time messaging capabilities. Users can experience instant message updates and engage in dynamic conversations with other users.
-   **Persistent Data:** The application uses SQLite as the database system, ensuring that conversations and user data are stored securely and can be accessed across different sessions.
-   **GIFs:** Users can search and send animated GIFs within their messages, adding a touch of fun and expressiveness to their conversations.
-   **Emotes:** The application provides a collection of emotes that users can use to enhance their messages and convey emotions effectively. Users can select from a wide range of predefined emotes.
-   **Profile Customization:** Users have the ability to customize their profile by adding a profile picture and 'about me' information. This feature allows users to personalize their presence and make their identity more recognizable to others.
-   **Online Status:** The Discord clone displays the online status of users, indicating whether they are currently active and available for communication. Users can see at a glance which of their friends or contacts are online and initiate conversations accordingly.
-   **Typing Status:** The application shows a typing status indicator when a user is in the process of composing a message. This feature provides real-time feedback to other participants in the conversation, letting them know that someone is actively typing a response.
